Right now, the current buying and selling methods are broken — they occur primarily offline (newspaper ads, posters, word of mouth). There are a few online competitors (a signal of demand), but they are outdated. Lifestyle businesses are becoming more popular — a marketplace like this can facilitate financing and discovery to make owning one of these businesses possible.", source: "RFS 100 newsletter", link: "https://rfs100.substack.com/p/avatars-chinese-e-commerce-and-tracking")

On a personal level, it would drastically improve the online shopping experience. On a more global and environmental level, it would result in fewer returns and more efficient production as retailers are able to better forecast customer sizing.", source: "RFS 100 newsletter", link: "https://rfs100.substack.com/p/avatars-chinese-e-commerce-and-tracking")

We're continuing to see a shift from thinking about supply-first (how much can we produce) to demand-first (how much do we need to produce). Solutions like Pinduoduo can limit supply chain waste, give consumers lower prices, and flip the cost structures of incumbents on their heads. It's a win-win.", source: "RFS 100 newsletter", link: "https://rfs100.substack.com/p/avatars-chinese-e-commerce-and-tracking")

Instead of user-generated lists, a modern platform for book recommendations would use some sort of algorithm to make suggestions based on personal rankings and taste graphs. Bringing back social and community elements could also help people discover others with similar preferences.", source: "RFS 100 newsletter", link: "https://rfs100.substack.com/p/cameo-for-normal-people-segment-for")

Because of this, I believe there is immense value in doing something very simple: getting the right information to the right person at the right time. I'd love to see a product that packages personal finance and 'adulting' content in a fun way that can become the pocket tool for the modern adult.", source: "RFS 100 newsletter", link: "https://rfs100.substack.com/p/cameo-for-normal-people-segment-for")

Large organizations have long counted on these to attract top talent but with much of the world working from home, there's ample opportunity to rethink benefits.

Fan sites aggregating relevant news about stars and their posts on social media could easily rank well on SEO. Even just a simple landing page with an email capture form would be useful. These could be sold back to the celebs or if they're not interested, serve as standalone businesses using affiliate links.", source: "My First Million podcast", link: "https://open.spotify.com/episode/2riDxsu51lCPFUTO5WEgtG?si=yiPf_q8IQXOriTpQwpXGFg")
